# To-do List #
To do list app similar to that of the reminders app in iOS. Plan to make this Java app more feature rich than the reminders app.

**NOTE: This to-do list is very basic but will get better over time**

Features:
* multiple to-do lists to keep track of different categories
* mark a task as complete but not necessarily delete it
* add, remove and shuffle tasks in terms of importance
* sort tasks based on completion
* importance weight to items in the todo list where it adds the task based on the importance on a scale of 1 to 10
* due date to tasks but not necessary to have one
* save my to-do lists to a file
* open to-do lists from a file (read somebody elses list or open your own on another device)

**PHASE 4: Task 2**
