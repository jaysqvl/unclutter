# To-do List #

This term, I will be creating a to-do list with the maximal amount of features necessary for a fully function list. Similar to the notes app on a Macbook, I want to create a lighter more robust version of the app.

**NOTE: This to-do list is very basic but will get better over time**

This project is interesting to me because it has twisted and turned my understanding of call graphs and the complexity of apps. I have a lot of interest in UX and design aka front end development so eventually I want it to run more pretty and smoothly.

### The todo list should have the following features
**PHASE 1:**
* As a user, I want to be able to make multiple to-do lists to keep track of different categories

* As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete

* As a user, I want to be able to add, remove and shuffle my tasks in terms of importance

* As a user, I want to add an importance weight to items in the todo list where it adds the task based on the importance on a scale of 1 to 10

* As a user, I want to be able to add a due date to tasks but not necessary to have one

**PHASE 2:**
* As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do lists to a file

* As a user, I want to be able to open to-do lists from a file (read somebody elses list or open your own on another device)

My aim is to be able to design this in a cleanly and readable manner

**PHASE 4: Task 2**

**PHASE 4: Task 3**

If I had more time to work on the project, I would definitely
create a more robust set of getters and setters with their
respective parameters. This is so that further development of
the app and its behaviours can more easily be diagnosed and
controlled. I also would have liked to play around with
refactoring for optimization because ArrayList is slow and
not particularly great at scaling up; potentially moving to
LinkedList. In terms of my UML Class design, I would not
refactor the structure of my project. It's clean, simple,
and separated in terms of UI.

I am very content with the organization that was
maintained through all parts of development of the project. 
Each of the classes have grouped methods based on the 
functionality that they provide to the app itself. Though 
not flawless design, due to the structure of the project, 
every bug and new implementation was easy to do, find and 
complete in a timely manner. It made it very easy to 
understand how the changes affected the system as a whole. 
This is in and of itself shows the benefit of improving the 
quality of your design structure.
